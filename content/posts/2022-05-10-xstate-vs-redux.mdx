Intro

## tl;dr

- XState can totally replace Redux as a global store
- XState is more flexible - it can also operate at the component level, replacing local component state
- XState can live alongside Redux, with Redux handling the global state and XState handling the local state
- We think XState's side effect management is better than redux-saga, redux-observable etc.
- XState is as good as Redux at only re-rendering when needed
- We think applications built with XState are easier to maintain than those built with Redux

## Background

We love Redux. The Redux maintainers are friends of ours, and we've taken a lot of inspiration from the way they work. The Redux docs are some of the best in the open-source world, and `@reduxjs/toolkit` has revolutionised how Redux apps are developed.

However, if we were to choose a state manager to build a frontend app today, we'd choose XState.

### Which flavour of Redux?

In this article, I'm going to refer to take 'Redux' to mean 'Modern Redux' - the version that uses `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The '2018 Redux' techniques (like `createStore`, `combineReducers`) are largely discouraged and [you should probably be using Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/introduction/why-rtk-is-redux-today).

## Replacing Redux

> Can I use XState as a global store?

Let's start the comparison here. You can replace 100% of your Redux code with XState code, and your app will work the same. XState can act as a global store which can receive events, update a data store, and manage side effects.

Just like Redux, XState can work across frameworks - you can use it in Vanilla JS, React, React Native, Vue, Svelte, or even in Node. Anywhere that JavaScript runs, both XState and Redux will run.

That means if you're committed to the Flux architecture, where your data is mostly stored at the root of your app, you can do the same thing in XState.

### Reducers vs Statecharts

Both XState and Redux have a similar setup for global state. You set up a single global 'root' of your app, composed of multiple smaller parts. In Redux, these are reducers, which mostly look like this:

```ts
const reducer = (state = { todos: [] }, event) => {
  if (event.type === "ADD_TODO") {
    return {
      ...state,
      todos: state.todos.concat(event.todo),
    };
  }
  return state;
};
```

You take in a state and an event. Based on how the event (for instance, `ADD_TODO`) interacts with the current state (a list of todo items), you return the new state.

Redux Toolkit adds some sugar syntax over this, including `immer` for safe mutable updates:

```ts
export const todoSlice = createSlice({
  name: "todo",
  initialState: {
    todos: [],
  },
  reducers: {
    addTodo: (state, event) => {
      state.todos.push(event.todo);
    },
  },
});
```

<!-- Example here showing the differences -->

## Why XState?

> If they do the same thing, why would I choose XState over Redux?

XState lets you visualise your code, making maintenance a breeze.

XState makes impossible things impossible.

XState has built-in side effect management.

XState is more flexible.

## What's the learning curve?

### Best of friends

You can use XState and Redux together _in the same app_. XState doesn't _need_ to be

### Bundle Size

### Architecture

## Themes

Side effect management (middleware vs native)

Reducers vs Statecharts

Application architecture

## Questions

Can you use XState as a Redux replacement?

Yes.

---

Can you handle a single global store with XState?

Yes.

---

How does XState handle side effects?

XState has native, all-in-one control of side effects.

---

Can you use middleware with XState?

It depends on what you're planning on using the middleware for.

---

Can XState and Redux live together?

Yes, in several different ways.

---

Can Redux handle 'selecting' state to reduce renders?

Yes, with `useInterpret` and `useSelector`.

---

Redux has strong opinions about your app architecture. What are XState's opinions?

---

Redux's dev tools are awesome. What does XState have?

---

How does the TypeScript experience compare?
