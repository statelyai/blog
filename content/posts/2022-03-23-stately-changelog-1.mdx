Happy Wednesday! Time for our first Editor Changelog blog, where we’ll talk about the new updates we’ve shipped in the editor.

## Snap To Elements

When you’re placing states and events in the canvas, you’ll now be able to snap them to surrounding elements.

Snapping is a hugely requested feature and should help make your charts neater and more legible.

So far, we’ve implemented snapping to the _center_ of elements only. We’re keen to [hear your feedback](https://github.com/statelyai/editor-feedback/issues) if you want more snapping!

## Right-click menu

You can now right-click events and states to perform actions including:

- Renaming states/events
- Making states the 'initial' state
- Adding guards
- Turning events into self-transitions

And many more.

## Visual update for events

We’ve streamlined the way our events look to make them more visually distinct from states. This new look keeps the focus on the arrow, the direction of travel, and the flow of the chart.

## Improvements to VSCode output

We’ve massively improved the way we handle transition targets in VSCode. Instead of every transition having an ugly `#(machine).state1.state2`, the VSCode extension will now make the most idiomatic choice out of `targetState`, `.targetState`, or `targetState.child`.

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "a",
  states: {
    a: {
      on: {
        EVENT: {
          // Before
          target: "#(machine).b",
        },
      },
    },
    b: {},
  },
});

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "a",
  states: {
    a: {
      on: {
        EVENT: {
          // After
          target: "b",
        },
      },
    },
    b: {},
  },
});
```

As part of this work, we’ve also improved how we handle `internal` - you’ll now get proper warnings inside the visual editor when you use `internal` incorrectly.

## Other Improvements

We’ve been hard at work fixing bugs in the VSCode extension and the CLI. You can keep up to date with those changes in our [`xstate-tools`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/releases) repo.
