React developers often need to share state between components. While the `useMachine(...)` hook provides a convenient way to represent local state as a state machine, it’s not very feasible for shared or global state. Thankfully, `@xstate/react`’s `createActorContext(machine)` function, released in `@xstate/react@3.1.0`, is a convenient way to share state machines globally in any React application.

The `createActorContext(machine)` function returns a [React Context object](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) that interprets the machine and makes the actor (interpreted machine) available through React Context. The object returned from `createActorContext(...)` has helper methods for accessing state and the actor ref. It takes one argument, `machine`, which is a state machine from `createMachine(...)` or a function that lazily returns a machine.

## Creating an actor context

Here’s how you would create a React Context for an actor created from a machine and provide it in app scope:

```tsx
// ./App.tsx
import { createActorContext } from "@xstate/react";
import { someMachine } from "../path/to/someMachine";

// Create a React Context for the actor
export const SomeMachineContext = createActorContext(someMachine);

// ...

function App() {
  return (
    // Provide the actor context in app scope
    <SomeMachineContext.Provider>
      <SomeComponent />
    </SomeMachineContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

This provider will make the actor available to any component that consumes it. You can also provide the actor context in any part of the component tree, such as a modal or a sidebar.

## Consuming the actor context

To consume the actor in a component, you can use the `useActor()` hook to get the `state` and `send` function, or you can use `useSelector(selector, compare?)` hook to derive a specific value from the snapshot:

```tsx
// ./SomeComponent.tsx
import { SomeMachineContext } from "./App";

function SomeComponent() {
  // Read full snapshot and get `send` function from `useActor()`
  const [state, send] = SomeMachineContext.useActor();
  // Or derive a specific value from the snapshot with `useSelector()`
  const count = SomeMachineContext.useSelector((state) => state.context.count);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => send({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As a reminder, the `useSelector(...)` hook is better when you want to control rerenders, as it will only rerender when the selected state changes.

If you only need the `actorRef`, which is a reference to the invoked actor, you can use the `useActorRef()` hook:

```tsx
import { SomeMachineContext } from "./App";

function SomeComponent() {
  const actorRef = SomeMachineContext.useActorRef();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => actorRef.send({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Providing custom machines

Lastly, if you need to provide implementation details to the machine, such as `actions`, `guards`, or `delays`, you can provide a machine in the `machine={...}` prop on the `Provider` component:

```tsx
import { SomeMachineContext } from "../path/to/SomeMachineContext";
import { someMachine } from "../path/to/someMachine";

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <SomeMachineContext.Provider
      machine={() =>
        someMachine.withConfig({
          actions: {
            doSomething: (ctx, ev) => {
              // ...
            },
          },
        })
      }
    >
      <SomeOtherComponent />
    </SomeMachineContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Note: the machine that you pass in should come from the same machine the context was created from, otherwise the types will be incorrect. Also, remember to wrap the custom machine in a function so that it’s lazily evaluated only once.

## Conclusion

The `createActorContext(...)` function from `@xstate/react` is a convenient way to share state machines globally in any React application, or in any part of the component tree. It is available as of version `@xstate/react@3.1.0`.
