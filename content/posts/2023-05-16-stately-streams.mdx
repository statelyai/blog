[Tomorrow is part four in our popular Stately Stream series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sigMw-Xelvw), where we are modeling a semi-complex client-side app using XState, Stately Studio, React and TypeScript. You can catch up on the previous videos in the series below or [watch all our past videos in our Stately Streams YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvWgkXBB3dd5UEJZCk4C3Wn1Ys8WRMDbi).

Across this series, David and I have been working on a canvas-based app project that showcases using statecharts for both components and globally accessible actors across an entire system, as well as multi-actor communication and state orchestration.

## Part 1

In part 1 we look at the power of using statecharts to model and implement a canvas-based app.

In part 2, we look at implementing multiple selection, including collision detection and what you might need for live collaboration.
