Last week we launched [the new Stately homepage](https://stately.ai), which we hope will make it easy to understand what Stately and XState are and help you convince your team to use state machines.

You can watch us talk about the new design and its implementation during [last week’s office hours](https://youtu.be/WoPCd4D--Gk?t=771). I’m particularly impressed by David’s SVG arrows!

And if you have any feedback about the homepage, please let us know on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate). We always appreciate your thoughts.
