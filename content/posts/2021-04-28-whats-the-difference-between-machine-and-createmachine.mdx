XState offers two options for declaring machine definitions:

```ts
import { Machine } from "xstate";

const machine = Machine({ ...config });
```

…or…

```ts
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({ ...config });
```

This can be confusing for beginners. Why are there two very similar-looking methods? What’s the difference?

## The Difference

In Javascript, there is no difference between the two. You can use them completely interchangeably.

In Typescript, there is only a small difference between them - it’s to do with the ordering of the generics you can pass to the machine. `Machine` allows you to pass a generic called ['Typestates'](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/typescript.html#typestates) in the middle of the `Context` and `Event` generics.

```ts
import { Machine } from "xstate";

interface Context {}

type Event = { type: "EVENT_NAME" };

type States = {};

const machine = Machine<Context, States, Event>({ ...config });
```

Whereas `createMachine` asks you to insert it at the end:

```ts
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

interface Context {}

type Event = { type: "EVENT_NAME" };

type States = {};

const machine = createMachine<Context, Event, States>({ ...config });
```

Whichever you choose, there is _no functional difference in the created machine_. The two functions reference the same code, and create the machine in the same way.

## What should I choose?

Going forward, you should use `createMachine`. That’s the syntax that will be preferred when v5 releases. But if you're happy with Machine, you can keep using it.
