This week we’ve added [our Roadmap](https://xstate.js.org/docs/roadmap) to the XState documentation.

Many of you have requested a roadmap to help you determine if it’s the right time to integrate XState and Stately tools into your team’s workflow. We’ve added a simple Roadmap so you know what we’re currently working on and what features are coming up soon.

## Upcoming features

To give you an idea of what we’re working on, below are the features currently planned for April - June 2022.

### XState

- XState v5 Alpha

### Editor

- Billing and Teams
- Feature parity with XState
- Authentication bug fixes
- Welcome emails
- Inline editing
- Simulation mode
- Markdown descriptions
- Workflow creation

### Documentation

- Stately tools visibility
- Update and rework

## Please give us your feedback and suggestions
