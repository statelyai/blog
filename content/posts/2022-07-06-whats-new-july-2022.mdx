On top of our usual minor improvements and bug fixes, we’ve got great new features to share with you in July!

## Search for machines

Thanks to Anders’ hard work, the [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) now has a fully-featured search where you can find and filter through all the machines our community has made.

The filters can limit your search by source, features and number of states.

![The discover page showing 101 search results for the “auth” keyword, each with the word “auth” highlighted in the title. The search is filtered by the Editor source, and also has the option to filter by features entry actions, exit actions, final states, guards, invoke, and
parallel states.](2022-07-06-search.png)

We have more planned for search in the future that we can’t wait to share with you.

## Pinch to zoom

Trackpad fans rejoice; you can now pinch to zoom in and out to navigate the editor’s canvas by touch. This feature was a popular request at a workshop Matt gave, so he implemented it the following day! If you prefer a keyboard or mouse, you can also use the zoom in and out buttons or the **+** and **-** keyboard shortcuts.

## Nesting typegen files

You’re missing out if you’re not using [our XState VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode) yet! After a top tip from our friend Erik Rasmussen, Anders added the feature to our VS Code extension. Read [Anders’ blog post on nesting XState typegen files](/blog/nesting-xstate-typegen-files) for more details.

## Labels on quick action buttons

The quick action buttons for adding states and guarded transitions are now labeled with **+ State** and **+ Guard** to make the buttons’ function clearer. Improvements that make the editor’s interface easier to understand and use are a priority for us, and we appreciate any feedback you have for improvements that would benefit you.
