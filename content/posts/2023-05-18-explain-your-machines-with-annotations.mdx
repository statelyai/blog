Sometimes you want to share a machine with descriptive details or comments, so we’ve added annotations to Stately Studio.  

Unlike [descriptions](https://stately.ai/docs/descriptions), annotations are notes you can use to annotate your machine that only appear in Stately Studio’s editor. To add an annotation, right-click anywhere on the canvas to bring up the canvas menu and use **Add annotation** to add your annotation.

[Check out the dog walk machine below](https://stately.ai/registry/editor/embed/5b170468-d66a-4136-84c8-676c8fea82e8?machineId=7879be19-d267-4e75-9a7d-6a870d540257), which I’ve annotated with notes describing the machine and how some of the states work.

*You can now also [embed your machines anywhere `iframe`s are supported](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-v5/embed)!*

Annotations are not exported when you [export your machine as code](https://stately.ai/docs/export-as-code), so you can add as many as you like without affecting your codebase!

Annotations are particularly useful when you’re sharing machines with your teams. [Teams](https://stately.ai/docs/teams) are a pro feature of Stately Studio, where you can share and collaborate on your app logic. We offer a **30-day free trial** on the [Stately Studio Pro account](https://stately.ai/pricing) so you can explore how our Pro features work for you and your team.

We hope annotations make sharing a link to your machine even easier without additional supporting information or explanation. Try them out today and see how they can enhance your workflow!
