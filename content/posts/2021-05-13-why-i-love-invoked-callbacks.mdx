XState offers several primitives for representing long-running application processes. These are usually expressed as [services](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/communication.html). I’ve written a bit about services [here](https://dev.to/mpocock1/xstate-should-this-be-an-action-or-a-service-2cp0) - but today I wanted to talk about my favourite way of expressing services: the Invoked Callback.

The [Invoked Callback](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/communication.html#invoking-callbacks) combines immense flexibility with good readability and a solid Typescript experience. They look like this:

```ts
createMachine({
  invoke: {
    src: (context, event) => (send, onReceive) => {
      // Run any code you like inside here

      return () => {
        // Any code inside here will be called when
        // you leave this state, or the machine is stopped
      };
    },
  },
});
```

Let’s break this down. You get access to `context` and `event`, just like promise-based services. But `send` is where things really get interesting. Let’s break down what makes `send` useful with an example.

## File Uploads

Imagine you need to build a file uploader, and you have a handy function called `startUpload` that uploads some data, and exposes an `onProgressUpdate` parameter to update the progress.

```ts
createMachine({
  context: {
    progress: 0,
  },
  initial: "idle",
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: {
        START: "pending",
      },
    },
    pending: {
      on: {
        PROGRESS_UPDATED: {
          assign: assign({
            progress: (context, event) => event.progress,
          }),
        },
        CANCEL: {
          target: "idle",
        },
      },
      invoke: {
        src: (context) => (send) => {
          const uploader = startUpload({
            onProgressUpdate: (progress) => {
              send({
                type: "PROGRESS_UPDATED",
                progress,
              });
            },
          });

          return () => {
            uploader.cancel();
          };
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This machine starts in the `idle` state, but on the `START` event begins its invoked service, which uploads the file. It then listens for `PROGRESS_UPDATED` events, and updates the context based on its updates.

The `CANCEL` event will trigger the `uploader.cancel()` function, which gets called when the state is left. React users may recognise this syntax - it’s the same as the cleanup function in the [useEffect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#cleaning-up-an-effect).

Note how simple and idiomatic it is to cancel the uploader - just exit the state, and the service gets cleaned up.

## Event Listeners

The invoked callback’s cleanup function makes it very useful for event listeners, for instance `window.addEventListener()`. XState Catalogue’s [Tab Focus Machine](https://xstate-catalogue.com/machines/tab-focus) is a perfect example of this - copied here for ease:

```ts
createMachine(
  {
    initial: "userIsOnTab",
    states: {
      userIsOnTab: {
        invoke: {
          src: "checkForDocumentBlur",
        },
        on: {
          REPORT_TAB_BLUR: "userIsNotOnTab",
        },
      },
      userIsNotOnTab: {
        invoke: {
          src: "checkForDocumentFocus",
        },
        on: {
          REPORT_TAB_FOCUS: "userIsOnTab",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    services: {
      checkForDocumentBlur: () => (send) => {
        const listener = () => {
          send("REPORT_TAB_BLUR");
        };

        window.addEventListener("blur", listener);

        return () => {
          window.removeEventListener("blur", listener);
        };
      },
      checkForDocumentFocus: () => (send) => {
        const listener = () => {
          send("REPORT_TAB_FOCUS");
        };

        window.addEventListener("focus", listener);

        return () => {
          window.removeEventListener("focus", listener);
        };
      },
    },
  }
);
```

When in the `userIsOnTab` state, we listen for the window’s `blur` event. When that happens, and `REPORT_TAB_BLUR` is fired, we clean up the event listener and head right on over to `userIsNotOnTab`, where we fire up the other service.

## Websockets

Invoked callbacks can also receive events via the `onReceive` function. This is perfect when you need to communicate to your service, such as sending events to websockets.

```ts
import { createMachine, forwardTo } from "xstate";

createMachine({
  on: {
    SEND: {
      actions: forwardTo("websocket"),
    },
  },
  invoke: {
    id: "websocket",
    src: () => (send, onReceive) => {
      const websocket = connectWebsocket();

      onReceive((event) => {
        if (event.type === "SEND") {
          websocket.send(event.message);
        }
      });

      return () => {
        websocket.disconnect();
      };
    },
  },
});
```

In order to receive events, services need an `id`. Not all events are forwarded to the invoked service, only those which we select via the `forwardTo` action.

Here, we can connect to the websocket, establish two-way communication, and clean it up all in a few lines of code.

## My Love Letter

Invoked callbacks are a concise, flexible method of invoking services in XState. There isn’t a case they can’t cover - and they’re one of my favourite parts of the XState API.
